                <p>Cardiovascular disease is the biggest cause of death in Ireland for both men and women. Healthy eating, being physically active and not smoking all help to reduce your chances of these diseases. One of the best ways to prevent heard disease and stroke is to keep your cholesterol at a healthy level.</p>
                <p>Corks Pharmacy can check your cholesterol level in store. This involves taking a small sample of blood (about one large drop) from the finger tip which is then put into a machine which measures the cholesterol level.</p>
                <p>We will let you know your cholesterol level and tell you what, if any, further action should be taken. By taking other risk factors into account (such as age, family history, smoking history etc), we will also be able to tell your overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease and give you advice on lowering your risk.</p>
                <p>Call us on 023 8846354 for more information or to make an appointment.</p>

                <strong>Relief from Food Intolerance Symptoms</strong>
                <p>Are you suffering from Digestive Problems, migraines or Skin Problems, Tiredness, Depression, Joint pain or Weight Gain?</p>
                <p>It could be that you are one of the 45%* of the population suffering from food intolerance. Food intolerance is different from food allergy in that symptoms are delayed, and usually more than one type of food is causing the problem. Symptoms of food intolerance are not life threatening, but they can still have a major impact. Often people with food intolerance take medicines to try and ease their symptoms rather than considering that food could be the cause.</p>
                <p>Typically each food intolerance sufferer will have their own pattern of symptoms and a unique “finger-print” of foods that they are reacting to. Working out which foods are causing particular symptoms is not easy when, unlike food allergy, food intolerance symptoms appear up to two or three days after eating the particular foods. You may be eating your problem food or foods every day without realising it.</p>
                <p>Based on years of research, 91% of Lorisian customers would recommend the test on offer, and scientific data collected from over 5000 users of the test show that over 3 out of 4 people feel better after acting on the results, the majority within three weeks.</p>
